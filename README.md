Sure, I'll create a `README.md` file for your repository. Here's a template you can use and customize as needed:

# Hypothesis Test

## Introduction

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. It is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameter. Hypothesis tests are used to test the validity of a claim or hypothesis about a population parameter.

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with Jupyter Notebook. You can install the required packages using the following command:

bash
pip install jupyter


## Usage

To use the notebooks, simply clone this repository and open the notebooks using Jupyter:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh572sg/Hypothesis_test.git
cd Hypothesis_test
jupyter notebook


Open the desired notebook and run the cells to perform the hypothesis tests.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or suggestions, please create a pull request or open an issue.




You can further customize this `README.md` to include more specific information about the hypothesis tests you have implemented or any other details relevant to your project.
